        help: Select the way you would like configurations to be written (provide integer 1 or 2). Currently there are 2 options.
          (1) which will write a single file per configuration. That file will have columns
          for the x, y corodenates of each vertex (from a single sublatice) and the "value" of the links around that
          sublatice. (2) will write all configurations to a single file. Each row will be a list of all
          link values for the whole configuration. The first column will be the (x=0,y=0) vertex E(ast) link. The
          second column will be the (0,0) vertex N(orth) link. The third column will be the (1,0) vertex E link... etc.
          ((0) will write every option for comparison)
